This is the companion repository for the following paper.

S. Zhang, Z. Ni, and L. Kuang, "Traffic Priority-aware Multi-user Distributed Dynamic Spectrum Access: A Multi-agent Deep RL Approach"   

Trained and tested with Python 3.6 + TensorFlow 1.12.0.  



How to use the code:
- To train the MARL-more model: train_more.py + env_network.py + Replay_memory.py 
- To train the  MARL-one model: train_one.py + env_network.py + Replay_memory.py 
- To test all models in the same environment: test_more_vs_one.py +env_network.py+ '/model'.
